        <h2>Not only a main dish</h2>
        <p>This broccoli Alfredo pasta is so pretty made with farfalle, also called bow-tie pasta. Of course, you may use fettuccine if you prefer.<br> As a main dish, this serves 2; as a side, it serves 4.br Add a salad, if you wish, and some bread. We love it as a side with grilled chicken or shrimp.</p>
