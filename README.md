# odin-recipes
Website about Recipes. Simple Html pages linked together with a list of recipes and ingredients. Simple HTML no CSS.

The purpose of this site is to put into practice what I learned so far. Create HTML pages, add Title and paragraphs, add links and lists of element, commit comments and commit changes to git hub
